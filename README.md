# rust-rocket-web-server
Basic example of a web server using the Rocket crate in the Rust language, made by following along with a youtube video at https://youtu.be/8RA6LSjXvRk

The resulting code will be similar to that of the author of the youtube video, found at https://github.com/iferc/basic-rocket-web-server, but will have some changes due to using Rocket v0.5.1 instead of v0.4.6 which has slight differences in its functions.
