# rust-rocket-web-server
Basic example of a web server using the Rocket crate in the Rust language, made by following along with a youtube video at https://youtu.be/8RA6LSjXvRk

The resulting code will be similar to that of the author of the youtube video, found at https://github.com/iferc/basic-rocket-web-server, but will have some changes due to using Rocket v0.5.1 instead of v0.4.6 which has slight differences in its functions.

This currently has no front end, and the main way to interact with it is by using curl in the CLI

There will be another repository called 'rust-rocket-web-server-rewrite' which will be this same functionality, but rewritten purely from memory and without looking at the reference video that this repo was made from.
